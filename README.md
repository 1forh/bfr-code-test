## Bonfire Red Code Test Instructions

We have provided a Photoshop file and a folder with images and fonts that you will need to create a simple one page website. Only the first image in the slider is visible in the Photoshop file, please make sure to include the slider-image-2 and slider-image-3 in that section.

Please try to match the design of the Photoshop file and any functionality that you see fit. This means it's completely open to your interpretation, so use any library/framework/whatever you deem necessary. Put your own spin on some of the elements, we’re not a typical digital shop and don’t want to see cookie-cutter thinking. Show us what makes you the best candidate by adding in your own flavor to what we’re asking here.
