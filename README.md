## Bonfire Red Code Test Instructions

We have provided a Photoshop file and a folder with images and fonts that you will need to create a simple one page website. Only the first image in the slider is visible in the Photoshop file, please make sure to include the slider-image-2 and slider-image-3 in that section.

Please try to match the design of the Photoshop file and any functionality that you see fit. This means it's completely open to your interpretation so use any library/framework/whatever you deem necessary. We wanna see what badass skillz you've got, so show us some cool stuff!
